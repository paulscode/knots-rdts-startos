/**
 * Chain-split recovery for the shared `bitcoind` datadir. Shared across every
 * bitcoind flavor's repo — keep the copies in sync; only the callers differ.
 *
 * All bitcoind flavors (Bitcoin Core, Bitcoin Knots pre-RDTS, Bitcoin Knots
 * RDTS) share one package id and one data volume, so a flavor switch carries
 * the source flavor's persisted per-block validity verdicts
 * (CBlockIndex::nStatus, serialized in blocks/index/) into the destination
 * binary. Those verdicts are trusted verbatim on startup — bitcoind never
 * re-validates buried blocks under the new binary's rules, and the persisted
 * validity level does not record which consensus rules produced it. Around a
 * contentious BIP-110 (RDTS) chain split that inheritance would make the node
 * follow the wrong chain in both directions. The two directions are fixed in
 * different places:
 *
 * - Leaving enforcement (switching to Core / pre-RDTS Knots): RDTS-driven
 *   BLOCK_FAILED_VALID marks persist, so the non-enforcing flavor refuses
 *   the most-work chain it would otherwise follow. The destination binary
 *   knows nothing about RDTS and cannot recognize those verdicts as foreign,
 *   so the package clears them: `reconsiderblock` each invalid chain tip
 *   (reconsiderInvalidTips), run by the flavor being switched *to*.
 * - Entering enforcement (switching to RDTS Knots, or a package update that
 *   moves the pin from a pre-RDTS to an RDTS release): blocks connected
 *   while enforcement was off are cache-valid and never re-checked against
 *   RDTS. Knots ≥ 29.4 re-validates the RDTS-applicable range itself at
 *   startup, so the package does nothing here.
 *
 * Enforcement model: whether a node enforces RDTS is a property of the
 * running *binary*, not of configuration. The RDTS-enforcing flavor pins an
 * official Knots release built with RDTS_CONSENT=RUNTIME_WARN
 * (contrib/guix/libexec/build.sh), which enforces on mainnet from its first
 * start regardless of `consensusrules` — that option only silences the
 * binary's consent warning, it does not gate enforcement. Bitcoin
 * Core and pre-RDTS Knots binaries never enforce. Callers therefore derive
 * enforcement from the node itself via isRdtsEnforcing (never-enforcing
 * flavors may hardcode false), and every flavor's main.ts records it in the
 * `rdtsEnforcedLastRun` store marker each start, treating a change as a
 * switch between enforcement regimes. That marker is what tells the
 * *non*-enforcing flavors that the verdicts they inherited are foreign, so
 * every flavor must keep writing it — including the enforcing one, which
 * never acts on it itself.
 *
 * The remedy is a safe no-op when there is nothing to fix, and self-heals: a
 * reconsidered block that is still invalid under the running rules is simply
 * re-marked invalid when its reconnection is attempted, and the node settles
 * on the best remaining valid chain.
